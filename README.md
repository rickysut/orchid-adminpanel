This repository containes a fresh installed <b>Laravel 9</b> project containing :
<ul>
    <li>laravel/ui</li>
    <li>Authentification scaffolding</li>
</ul>

Bootstrap 4 is replaced by <b>Bootstrap 5</b> (including the Bootstrap 5 Icons) and the scaffolding files are recreated using the Bootstrap 5 framework.

This is a very good starting point if you want to develop applications using <b>Laravel 9 and Bootstrap 5</b>.

<b>Be aware you need at least PHP 8.0 to use this project!</b>
